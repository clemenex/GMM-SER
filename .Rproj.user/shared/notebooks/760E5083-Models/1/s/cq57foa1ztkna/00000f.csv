  Links: mu = identity; sigma = identity 
Formula: pitch_sd ~ 1 + (1 | participant_id) 
   Data: df (Number of observations: 2997) 
  Draws: 4 chains, each with iter = 4000; warmup = 1000; thin = 1;
         total post-warmup draws = 12000

Draws were sampled using sampling(NUTS). For each parameter, Bulk_ESS
and Tail_ESS are effective sample size measures, and Rhat is the potential
scale reduction factor on split chains (at convergence, Rhat = 1).
